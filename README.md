## Introduction

Currency detection is an important task in various financial and commercial applications. This project aims to provide a solution that can identify different currencies accurately and reliably. The project primarily uses image processing and machine learning techniques to achieve this goal.

## Features

- **Currency Recognition:** The application can identify various currencies from input images.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained models are available for easy integration and usage.
- **Scalability:** The project is designed to be scalable for adding new currencies or improving the existing recognition models.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishek3689/Currency_Object_Detection.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, follow these steps to use the application:

1. Ensure you have the necessary image(s) of the currency to test.
2. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python detect_currency.py --input your_currency_image.jpg
    ```

   Replace `your_currency_image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to analyze.

## Model Training

If you want to contribute to model training or improve the existing models, follow these steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather images of various currencies.
2. **Model Development:** Train the model using the provided scripts or develop new models.
3. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance and iterate on improvements.
